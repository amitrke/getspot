## Firebase Configuration

- **Project ID:** `getspot01`
- **Region:** us-east4 (Northern Virginia)
- **Firestore:** Rules and indexes configured
- **Functions:** TypeScript with Node.js 22
- **Hosting:** www.getspot.org

## Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns

**1. Write-to-Trigger Pattern** (Event Registration)
- Client writes "requested" status
- Cloud Function processes and updates status
- Real-time listener updates UI

**2. Callable Function Pattern** (Group Creation)
- Atomic operations with transactionality
- Returns result synchronously
- Server-side validation

**3. Denormalized Data** (User Memberships)
- Fast lookups without expensive collection group queries
- `/userGroupMemberships/{userId}/groups/{groupId}`
- Maintained by Cloud Functions

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

**Development Principles:**
- Prefer Cloud Function triggers for invariants
- Use batched writes/transactions for multi-document consistency
- Add composite indexes proactively
- Include rationale comments for maintainability
