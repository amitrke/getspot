### 1. Create Your Group

### 2. Schedule Events
Create events with all the details: date, time, location, max participants, and fee. Set a commitment deadline to ensure reliable attendance.

### 3. Players Register
Members register with one tap. Fee is deducted immediately - if spots are full, they join the waitlist (still paid, guaranteed spot if one opens).

### 4. Automatic Management
- Waitlisted players automatically promoted when spots open
- Refunds processed automatically for cancellations
- Reminders sent 24 hours before events
- Real-time participant counts

### 5. Show Up & Play!
Everyone knows who's coming, payments are handled, and you can focus on the game.

## 💰 Simple Virtual Wallet System

**No Payment Processing Hassle**

GetSpot uses a virtual currency system that keeps things simple:

1. **Organizers "sell" credits** to members offline (cash, Venmo, whatever you prefer)
2. **Organizers credit wallets** through the app
3. **Players use credits** to register for events
4. **Automatic accounting** - Every transaction is tracked

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No payment gateway fees
- ✅ No credit card processing
- ✅ You keep using your existing payment methods
- ✅ Full transparency for all members
- ✅ Automatic refund handling

## ❓ Common Questions

### Is GetSpot really free?
Yes! No subscription, no transaction fees, completely free.

### Do I need a business account or payment gateway?
Nope! GetSpot uses a virtual currency system. You handle real payments however you want (cash, Venmo, Zelle, etc.), then credit wallets through the app.

### What happens if someone cancels last minute?
If they cancel after the commitment deadline, they forfeit their fee (unless someone from the waitlist takes their spot). This encourages reliable attendance.

### Can I use GetSpot for multiple groups?
Absolutely! Players can join multiple groups with one account. Organizers can create and manage multiple groups too.

### What if I need a feature that's not available?
We're actively developing! Check out our [roadmap](./PRODUCT.md) or submit a feature request via GitHub Issues.

### Is my data safe?
Yes! We use Firebase with industry-standard security. Your payment information never touches our servers (since you handle real payments offline). See our [Privacy Policy](./privacy.md).

### Can I customize the app for my sport?
Currently GetSpot works great for all sports. Sport-specific features (like court assignments, skill-based matching) are on our [roadmap](./PRODUCT.md).
