## Vision & Goals

GetSpot streamlines the organization of local sports meetups, starting with badminton. The app connects organizers with participants, simplifying event creation, registration, and communication, with a focus on recurring games for established groups.

### Key Success Metrics
- Group retention rate
- Events per group per month
- Participant registration rate
- Wallet transaction volume
- User-reported satisfaction

---

## User Roles

### Participant (Default Role)
Every user starts as a participant with these capabilities:
- âœ… Request to join groups
- âœ… View and register for events
- âœ… Manage event attendance
- âœ… View wallet balance and transaction history
- âœ… Receive push notifications

### Organizer (Group Admin)
Users who create groups automatically become admins with additional capabilities:
- âœ… Create and manage groups
- âœ… Approve/deny join requests
- âœ… Create and cancel events
- âœ… Credit virtual currency to member wallets
- âœ… Remove members from groups
- âœ… Post announcements to group

---

## Core Concepts

### Groups
- âœ… Any user can create a group with unique shareable code
- âœ… Membership requires admin approval
- âœ… Each group has configurable negative balance limit
- âœ… Members can belong to multiple groups

### Event Commitment & Fee Model
**Philosophy:** Ensure event spots are paid for, giving organizers confidence to manage events.

**Flow:**
1. âœ… Participant must have sufficient balance: `walletBalance + negativeBalanceLimit >= fee`
2. âœ… Fee deducted immediately upon registration
3. âœ… Status assigned: "Confirmed" (spot available) or "Waitlisted" (event full)
4. âœ… Withdrawals before commitment deadline: full refund
5. âœ… Withdrawals after deadline: forfeit fee (unless spot filled from waitlist)
6. âœ… Automatic waitlist promotion when spots open
7. âœ… Automatic refunds for unfilled waitlist spots after event ends

### Virtual Currency
- âœ… Organizers "sell" virtual currency offline
- âœ… Organizers credit participant wallets via app
- âœ… Participants use currency for event fees
- âœ… Transaction history tracked per user
- ðŸ“‹ Future: Real payment integration (Stripe)

### Waitlist System
- âœ… Join waitlist when event is full (fee paid upfront)
- âœ… Automatic promotion to confirmed when spot opens
- âœ… Withdraw anytime for full refund
- âœ… Automatic refund if event ends without getting spot
